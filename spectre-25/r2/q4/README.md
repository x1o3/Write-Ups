Eve faces a Riftwalker in a rapid-fire trivia duel, with her team’s combined knowledge securing victory. Kira Morrow’s message echoes: "Knowledge is the foundation, but wisdom lies in how we share it." The key fragment then appears: "Unity unlocks the future."

- we got a file named CvqZhRQX6QxnwSdNV70yYW8jGY0+Xsyt , `file` command tells us its  a zip , opening it in gui reveals the file in it , `d3s:67575768` 

- this tells us it is des encryption but d3s ecryption needs a 24 bit key while we have only 8 bits `67575768
 `
- no we needed to repeat that thrice , it was also given in the free hint `Victory is in the details—repetition reveals patterns. Pay attention to the cycles, and the key will reveal itself.`

- so the des-cbc decryption gives us  7546466675674756587 i.e the password for the zip file

- in the zip file we have :
	n : 2956183112176302343819566655710139
	e : 17
	c : 789269312820461742969346331358248
as the n < c this points to being an RSA encryption

now to use sites like tausquared.net to decrypt rsa we need p and q and for that we can go to anoher site called factordb cause the number is small enough to be factorized

putting n there gives us 35179554143206241 and 84031284198273179
using them as p and q having c and e , we can find secret msg to be 
893483117953103483116953493116

`Answer : OSCTF{893483117953103483116953493116}`
